         <p>This app allows you to simulate a round of golf by customizing your club distances and playing through
            different
            holes. Simply enter the yardage for each club based on your potential maximum distance. Once set up, you can
            play
            through a round without having to look for yardage markers, making it easier and more enjoyable to focus on
            your
            game.
